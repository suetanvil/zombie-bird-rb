This is a Derived Work based on the code and assets produced by
kilobolt.com for the "Zombie Bird" tutorial at
<http://www.kilobolt.com/zombie-bird-tutorial-flappy-bird-remake.html>.

According to the tutorial's introductory text,

    We will produce all the source code, sound effects and art assets
    in-house at Kilobolt, and provide all of these, free of charge, to
    you. You are free to do with it what you wish.

    For those who would like to upload the game on the Play Store/App
    Store, my one request is that you add something substantially NEW
    to the game. Make it a better product. We don't need 10,000
    identical games on the Play Store with identical graphics and
    gameplay.

    Also, we are not responsible if some person with poor judgment
    plays your game, fails and decides to take out his anger on the
    world by creating a super-virus that turns you into a zombie.
